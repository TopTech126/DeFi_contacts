# Read Data From Smart Contract

[Watch Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFdjZ-B3GCM&list=PLS5SEs8ZftgXlCGXNfzKdq7nGBcIaVOdN&index=3)

This step covers the latter part of the video.

In this step we are sending ethers from account 1 to account 2 on ropston network. 

You can create an account using metamask for this step and load it with test ethers from a ropston faucet like https://faucet.ropsten.be/

You will see in the code that here we have explicitly signed our transaction using the private key. This is how you should go about sending transactions in a public block chain where the nodes cannot be trusted with your private keys.

npm link typescript

npm start

or

tsc

node index
