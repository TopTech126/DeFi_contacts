# Projects

## Project 1: Create an ERC20 Token

 Create a YourNameCoin e.g. WarisCoin on the Ropsten Test Network. Mint 1,000 these Coins and transfer them to Your Metamask wallet address. Then send these coins to your friends including me. 

 My metamask address is: 0xA31Fa5D96441645FCeD6F09743cA5703605817Ca . 

 Once you have sent me some of your coins send me a message here

## Project 2: Create an NFT

Everyone, after you have coded a ERC 20 Token and transferred some to me, the next project is that you create an NFT Ropsten test network and transfer it to me follow these two tutorials:

[Read Parts 1, 2, and 3 of this tutorial](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/)



## Project 3: Create and Deploy a DiFi App 

[CREATE AND DEPLOY A DEFI APP TUTORIAL](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/create-and-deploy-a-defi-app/)


## Project 4: Create a Dummy DEX 

We will create a dummy decentralized exchange where a user can trade Ethereum with our newly deployed YourNameCoin (created in project 1). After that, we’ll now learn how to wait for a transaction to be mined and get it’s result. We will finish the project by learning how to decode and make sense of event logs generated by Ethereum transactions.

In short, we will create a dummy DEX, once you make a transaction on it we use Javascript to wait and get details about the transactions that were made to your DEX contract and we will end by learning to decode events generated by token transfers or any other events as long as you have the ABI.

## Project 6: Payment Splitter

We want to create a Payment Splitter smart contract that will distribute the payments received in DAI to all the current holders of YourNameCoin in proportion to their holdings (Project 1).
