# Hello World Dapp

[We are roughly going to follow this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swZRo6LFrCw)

npx create-react-app step21_hellowworld_dapp --template typescript

cd step21_helloworld_dapp

npm install ethers

npm start

Now create the src/SimpleStorage.tsx React component and import and use it in src/App.tsx

To add ethereum types which the browser injects to windows type we will install, read details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65504958/web3-js-extending-the-window-interface-type-definitions):

npm install @metamask/providers

Now add the following code in the src/App.tsx (This is not mentioned in the video tutorial):

    import { MetaMaskInpageProvider } from "@metamask/providers";

    declare global {
        interface Window {
            ethereum: MetaMaskInpageProvider;
        }
    }




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
