## The Real Estate Tokenization Technical Options

Real estate can’t directly be tokenized, but legal entities can. Each property is owned by a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC). Each LLC is tokenized to specific RealTokens and made available for purchase. We have two options to implement this either by tokenizing (ERC-20) the complete project, or tokenizing (NFT ERC-1155) each idependent units seprately (However, these NFTs will be Fractional i.e. implementing ERC-1155)

1. Tokenize (ERC-20) the Company that owns and manages the Real-Estate Property
Create an LLC in USA or [Special Purpose Vehicle in Dubai](https://smartcrowd.ae/how-it-works/) for the project and issue ERC 20 Tokens for the LLC or SPV in the Global Crypto Market. This will be like raising funds for any project. 
ERC 20 Tokens are easy to understand but we will have do our own crowd sale and its marketing. We will also have to create our own secondary marketplace for ERC 20 Real-Estate Tokens. This is going to be very expensive marketing and development wise. The liquidity of these tokens will be very limited i.e. only in our own marketplace or we will have to register with an exchange.

2. Create a Company for every Independent Unit of Real-Estate, and issue a NFT (ERC-1155) for it
Each NFT will represent a single independent unit of the property i.e. flat or piece of land. The collection will represent the complete property.
The NFTs can be sold on the NFT marketplace like the https://opensea.io/
It will also provide liquidity to the owner because he can sell it easily on the NFT marketplace.
The downside is that NFT price may be high, however this issue can be solved by issuing Fractional NFT's i.e. ERC-1155 instead of ERC-721.
