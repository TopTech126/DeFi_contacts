Copy the files from step00_hardhat_helloworld

Read a tutorial topic; to practice add a contract and a test 

Go over each and every topic in the tutorial one by one

npx hardhat compile

tsc

npx hardhat test




This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
