# Fail Early and Fail Loud Design Pattern

[We will follow this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ethereum-solidity-smart-contract-design-patterns-wael-yousfi/)

In a function we should check the condition required for execution as early as possible in the function body and throws an exception if the condition is not met. This is a good practice to reduce unnecessary code execution in the event that an exception will be thrown.
