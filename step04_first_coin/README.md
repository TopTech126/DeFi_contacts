# Develop First ERC-20 Coin using Hardhat Typescript Project

[We will follow this tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/ethereum/create-erc20-token-tutorial)

Note: After Solidity 0.8 SafeMath Library is [no longer required](https://soliditydeveloper.com/solidity-0.8) because it is already integrated.

Copy the files from step01_hardhat_typescript_helloworld

Create the FirstCoin.sol

Update the test file

tsc

npx hardhat compile

npx hardhat test




This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
