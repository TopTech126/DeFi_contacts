[Watch Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFdjZ-B3GCM&list=PLS5SEs8ZftgXlCGXNfzKdq7nGBcIaVOdN&index=3)


This step covers the initial part of the video.

We are creating a transaction using web3js to send ethers from account1 to account2.
In this example we are creating transactions using ganache, therefore all the public addresses are unlocked and the node takes care of signing of the transaction.

You can download ganache from 

https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache


Ganache creates many public addresses for you. You can use them

npm link typescript

npm start

or

tsc

node index
